# Enterprise Authentication on WiFi (WPA2)
A colection of examples for a note in my blog

See [my blog](http://www.scaprile.com/2021/06/09/autenticacion-empresarial-en-wi-fi/) for further info.

PS: Yes, there are secret keys here, this is from a bogus server and the idea is to try the examples without having to learn to admin a Certification Authority nor master openSSL's extensive command line options.
